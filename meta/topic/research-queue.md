# Research Queue

Unconfirmed leads, secondary-source findings, and unbuilt stubs ordered
by priority.

Two backlogs live here, distinguished by origin:

- **Queue** (top) — leads that don't yet have a `[/path]` reference in
  any built node. These are "here's a lead; no node home yet."
- **Priority Build Queue** — unbuilt stubs that are already referenced
  by built nodes (visible in `scripts/validate.py` broken-link
  registry), curated here with priority and rationale.

---

## Formatting rules

- **Priority values:** High, Medium, Low
- **Status values:** Pending, In-progress, Blocked
- **Active items only.** When a queued item is built, remove its row —
  git log is the build-history record (`git log --diff-filter=A`).

---

## Queue

*Empty.* All current leads have `[/path]` references in built nodes and
appear in the Priority Build Queue below.

| Item | Source | Found In | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Priority Build Queue

Unbuilt-stub targets referenced from the 14 built nodes (3 people +
2 organizations + 2 events + 3 documents + 3 transcripts + 1 media).
Grouped by natural cluster so contributors can choose which ring to
close first.

### Cluster A — 2004 Nimitz encounter (F.2c pilot shipped 2026-04-19; FLIR1 F.4c pilot shipped 2026-04-20)

The encounter event and FLIR1 media node are built; the cluster's
remaining work is corroborator people nodes (Dietrich, Underwood)
and the supporting organization nodes.

| Path | Type / Kind | Priority | Rationale | Source Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/people/alex-dietrich` | person / eyewitness | High | Co-observer (Fravor's wingman); named in Fravor testimony + multiple interview transcripts | Fravor testimony + CBS 60 Minutes 2021-05-16 transcript (archived) |

| `/organizations/ttsa` | organization / private | Medium | Formation narrative in Fravor testimony | Corporate registrations + public record |
| `/people/jay-stratton` | person / institutional-actor | Medium | Named in Fravor testimony as 2009 contact; AATIP / UAPTF relevance | Public record (Coulthart book; AARO HRR) |
| `/people/luis-elizondo` | person / institutional-actor | Medium | Named in Fravor testimony; AATIP disclosure lead | Extensive public record (2023 House testimony + book) |
| `/people/tom-delonge` | person / reporter (or private?) | Low | TTSA co-founder; named in Fravor testimony | Public record |

### Cluster B — 2023-07-26 House Oversight hearing (complete 2026-04-20)

Ring complete — hearing event node, all three oral transcripts
(Fravor, Grusch, Graves), all three written testimony documents, and
all three witness person nodes (Fravor, Grusch, Graves) built.
Remaining stubs below are cross-cluster dependencies surfaced by the
Cluster B build (Kirkpatrick also appears in Cluster D AARO
leadership; Gallaudet is cross-referenced from Graves's testimony;
ODNI report is a foundational document referenced from Graves).

| Path | Type / Kind | Priority | Rationale | Source Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/people/sean-kirkpatrick` | person / institutional-actor | Medium | AARO founding director; named in Graves testimony | 2023-04-19 SASC testimony (archived) |
| `/people/tim-gallaudet` | person / institutional-actor | Medium | Former NOAA Chief Scientist and Deputy Administrator; UAP advocate | Public record |
| `/documents/odni-preliminary-assessment-2021` | document / gov-doc | Medium | Referenced in Graves testimony; foundational UAP report | ODNI (public PDF; archived) |

### Cluster C — NYT 2017 disclosure chain

Secondary cluster surfaced through Fravor testimony narrative.

| Path | Type / Kind | Priority | Rationale | Source Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/people/leslie-kean` | person / reporter | Low | NYT Dec 2017 co-author; named in Fravor testimony | Public record (byline history + book) |

### Cluster D — UAP oversight institutions (AARO + UAPTF shipped 2026-04-20)

AARO and UAPTF now built, closing the two central gov nodes in this
cluster. Remaining stubs (surfaced by the AARO + UAPTF builds):

| Path | Type / Kind | Priority | Rationale | Source Access |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/organizations/oni` | organization / gov | High | Office of Naval Intelligence — UAPTF's parent; referenced across AARO + UAPTF + multiple person/document nodes | Navy public record + ODNI Preliminary Assessment (archived) |

## Completed audits

Nodes audited via `prompts/audit.md`. Build history is in git; this
table tracks audit history only.

| Node | Audit date |

## Milestones

Long-term structural improvements not blocked on primary sources.

| Milestone | Description | Target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Close Cluster A (Nimitz) ring | Build Dietrich + FLIR1 + key orgs (Nimitz / Princeton / VFA-41) so Fravor's broken-link stubs resolve | F.2c + F.3 + F.4 shipped; FLIR1 built; Dietrich + orgs remain | In progress |
| Close Cluster B (2023-07-26 hearing) ring | Build Grusch doc + Grusch/Graves transcripts + Grusch/Graves person | Hearing event + all three transcripts + all three written testimony docs + all three witness person nodes built | Done |
| Close Cluster D (UAP oversight institutions) ring | Build AARO + UAPTF + their support stubs (ONI, NIA, Norquist, Travis Taylor, etc.) | AARO + UAPTF built; ONI, NIA, Norquist, Taylor stubs surfaced and queued | In progress |
| First finding node | Build a cross-entity finding spanning 3+ nodes (e.g., UAP video-release provenance chain) | After ≥3 cluster rings close | Pending |
