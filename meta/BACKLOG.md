# BACKLOG

Deferred work items — real, concrete, and would be lost otherwise. Not
on the active roadmap. Items leave when (a) promoted to a roadmap phase,
(b) addressed, or (c) superseded.

Open items are partitioned into three sections by dependency shape:
**A — Priority sequence** (ordering / coupling constraints),
**B — Parallel batch** (renderer-pass items that ship together),
and **C — Anytime** (no upstream blockers). Item identifiers are
A1, A2, ..., B1, B2, ..., C1, C2, ... — within each section,
retired items leave a gap rather than shifting remaining IDs, so
git-log and commit-message references stay valid. The same
gap-stable policy in `meta/conventions.md` applies to validator
check names.

**Default focus: Section C.** C items have no upstream dependencies
and can be picked up and finished in a single pass. A and B items
carry ordering or coupling constraints — starting one without its
dependencies risks half-baked implementations and leaves the BACKLOG
cluttered with partial work. For ad-hoc sessions, prefer C work.
Reserve A and B for sessions explicitly scoped to those tracks.

Items waiting on an external event the repo can't drive (FOIA
resolution, registry access, third-party publication) and that are
**topic-specific** to the current investigation live in
`meta/topic/research-queue.md` "Externally blocked" — that's the fork-
boundary-correct home for them. If a genuinely toolkit-neutral
externally-blocked item ever surfaces (rare), reinstate the
"Externally blocked" heading at the bottom of this file.

---

## A. Priority sequence

Items with ordering or coupling constraints.

*No priority-sequence items currently open.*

---

## B. Parallel batch (renderer pass)

Items that touch the renderer and naturally batch into a single
polish pass — bundling reduces churn vs. shipping each as a
separate touch.

*No parallel-batch items currently open.*

---

## C. Anytime (no dependencies)

Items with no upstream blockers; safe to pick up at any point in
any session. Per the preamble, this is the default-focus tier:
C work doesn't risk half-baked implementations.

*No anytime items currently open.* (C1 retired 2026-05-17 —
shipped as `scripts/tools/extract-firefox-cookies.py`; ID held
open per the gap-stable retirement rule.)
